This repository contains waveform plots and controls that can be used to jump start your AudioKit-powered app. 

## Requirements

We use SwiftUI so you need to target iOS13+ and macOS 10.15+.

## Installation via Swift Package Manager

To add AudioKitUI to your Xcode project, select File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Depedancy. Enter `https://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKitUI` for the URL. 

## Examples

Just like AudioKit, the example project for AudioKitUI is the [AudioKit Cookbook](https://github.com/AudioKit/Cookbook/).
