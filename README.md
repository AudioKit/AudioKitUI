Waveform plots and controls that can be used to jump start your AudioKit-powered app.

## Documentation

Complete API reference appears in the [AudioKit.io web site](https://www.audiokit.io/AudioKitUI/documentation/audiokitui)

## Requirements

We use SwiftUI so you need to target iOS 13+ and macOS 10.15+.

## Installation via Swift Package Manager

To add AudioKitUI to your Xcode project, select File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency. Enter `https://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKitUI` for the URL.

## Examples

Just like AudioKit, the example project for AudioKitUI is the [AudioKit Cookbook](https://github.com/AudioKit/Cookbook/).

## More!

Because some user interfaces are quite complex, and don't really have AudioKit as a dependency, we will be putting them in other repositories under the AudioKit umbrella.
